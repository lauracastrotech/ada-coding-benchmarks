# Coding Benchmark: Python & JavaScript Fundamentals

Welcome to the Ada Developers Academy Coding Benchmark! This short benchmark is designed to assess your understanding of programming fundamentals in **Python** and **JavaScript** after \~4 months of study. It includes basic syntax, logic, data structures, and two intermediate challenges: **recursion** and **sorting**.

---

## 🧪 Purpose

* Solidify your understanding of core concepts
* Practice reading and writing clean code
* Evaluate your grasp of both languages under timed conditions

---

## 📋 Rules

* No internet searching or external help
* Use **print statements** to test your non-challenge code
* For the recursion and sorting problems, use the included minimal test suite
* Time limit: **90 minutes** max
* Complete all answers in the provided `.py` and `.js` files

---

## ✅ What to Complete

* `benchmark.py`
* `benchmark.js`

You should:

* Complete each problem directly beneath its comment prompt
* For the final two challenge problems (recursion and sorting):

  * Write your implementation
  * Use the provided test suite to verify correctness

---

## 🧪 How to Run Tests

### Python (pytest)

1. Ensure you have `pytest` installed:

```bash
pip install pytest
```

2. Run:

```bash
pytest benchmark.py
```

### JavaScript (Jest)

1. Ensure `jest` is installed:

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest
```

2. Add to `package.json` if needed:

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "jest"
}
```

3. Run:

```bash
npm test
```

---

## 🧠 Topics Covered

* Variables and data types
* Loops
* Conditionals
* Arrays and objects
* Functions
* Recursion (challenge)
* Sorting algorithms (challenge)

---

## 🔁 Challenge Problems (Same in Both Languages)

1. **Recursion**: Write a function that returns the nth Fibonacci number
2. **Sorting**: Implement your own version of **bubble sort**

Good luck — and remember: clarity > cleverness!
